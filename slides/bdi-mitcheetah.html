  Since then, we've seen tremendous accomplishments in planning and control for legged robots. Boston Dynamics' quadrupeds (BigDog, LS3, Wildcat, and Spot) have demonstrated that robust controllers and reflexes can can produce impressive walking and running over a variety of terrains. Closer to home, Sangbae Kim's Biomemetic Robotics Lab has shown off fantastic running leaps over obstacles up to 80% of their robot's leg length. They're able to do this by planning (online!) a trajectory for the robot over that class of obstacle. Neither of these approaches answer the question, however, of how to move quickly in situations that call for precise footstep placement.
